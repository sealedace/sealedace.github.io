        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="meta">Last Updated: February 3, 2026</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the
            <strong>TrackLife</strong> mobile application (the "App") operated by us.</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the
            terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Use License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to download and use one copy of the App specifically for personal, non-commercial
            transitory use only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title.</p>
        <p>Under this license, you may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
            </li>
            <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the App;</li>
            <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
            us at any time.</p>

        <h2>2. User Data and Cloud Services</h2>
        <p>Our App leverages Apple's iCloud service to store and synchronize your data. By using the App, you
            acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your iCloud account.</li>
            <li>We do not thereby own or have access to the data you store in iCloud via the App.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for any data loss caused by iCloud service outages or synchronization errors.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions (If applicable)</h2>
        <p>Some parts of the Service may be billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). If you choose to
            purchase a subscription:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
            <li>Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of
                the current period.</li>
            <li>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions in your Apple ID Account Settings after purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The materials within the App are provided on an 'as is' basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied,
            and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
            conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
            property or other violation of rights.</p>
        <p>Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or
            reliability of the use of the materials on the App.</p>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall we be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
            profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the App, even if we or
            an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>

        <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
            developer resides, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will notify
            you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page.</p>
