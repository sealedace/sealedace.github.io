In addition to its many other fine attributes, the Clang compiler also provides a clean API that makes it easy to use its facilities as a library in your own code. Today, I'm going to give a basic introduction to this library and how to use it, a topic suggested by reader Jeffrey Macko.

除了

Getting the Library
The library version of Clang is called, creatively, libclang. Xcode uses libclang extensively, and embeds the dylib that you can conveniently use yourself. You wouldn't want to use this in a shipping app, but it's a great way to get started and experiment. It's buried deep in the app, but this command will get you the path:

    echo `xcode-select --print-path`/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/libclang.dylib
You'll also need to add the enclosing directory to your runpath so that the dynamic linker can find the library at runtime. If you're building from the command line, you can do this by passing -rpath followed by the path to the lib directory above. In full, you'll want to pass these parameters when linking:

    clang `xcode-select --print-path`/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/libclang.dylib -rpath `xcode-select --print-path`/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib ...
Getting the Headers
Unfortunately, Xcode doesn't ship the headers for this library. The good news is that it's intended to provide a stable API, and so you can just go fetch the headers from the Clang project's subversion repository. The C headers for libclang can be found here:

http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/include/clang-c/

You can easily grab a local copy for yourself:

    svn export http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/include/clang-c/
Documentation
Documentation for libclang can be found here:

http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html

The C API is done in a fairly reasonable object-oriented style and is fairly easy to follow. I couldn't find any master overview document that discusses how to get started, but that's what this article is for!

Getting Started
The top-level object where everything else starts is called an index. Although it does more, libclang was originally built to help with code completion and indexing source files, and it looks like the name came from that. Creating an index is pretty easy:

    CXIndex index = clang_createIndex(0, 0);
The two parameters are boolean options. The first one determines whether declarations from PCH files are excluded. that doesn't really matter for my purposes, since I'm not using a PCH, but not excluding them seems like a decent start. The second parameter determines whether diagnostics are printed when parsing source code. If set, libclang will print warnings and errors just like the compiler would. I disabled this so that I can take control of how diagnostics are shown.

Next comes parsing a translation unit. In C terminology, a translation unit is basically a single compiled source file. Parsing a translation unit with libclang is much like compiling a file. It's so similar that you give the function command-line arguments just like you'd give them to clang on the command line. Let's start off with the arguments, which are just a couple of include paths needed to make the code compile properly:

    const char *args[] = {
        "-I/usr/include",
        "-I."
    };
It also wants to know how many arguments there are, which I compute from the array:

    int numArgs = sizeof(args) / sizeof(*args);
Next, parse the file. The function takes the index to work with, the file to parse, and the command line arguments. It also takes unsaved files to take into account, which I'm not going to use here. This allows you to, for example, #include files that you have in memory but haven't saved to disk. Finally, it takes a set of options for the parse, which allows you to do things like specify that the file is incomplete, that the results are intended for serialization, and other such things. No options are required here. This is the complete call:

    CXTranslationUnit tu = clang_parseTranslationUnit(index, "libclang.m", args, numArgs, NULL, 0, CXTranslationUnit_None);
Now we have a translation unit loaded. What do we do with it?

Examining Diagnostics
First, I want to print any diagnostics produced when parsing the file. I could have had this for free by passing 1 to clang_createIndex, but what fun would that be? More to the point, although printing these diagnostics at the command line isn't all that useful, this allows you to do more interesting things like show these diagnostics in a UI, or use them to annotate a source file, or anything else that doesn't involve simply printing them.

The first step is to find out just how many diagnostics were produced by the translation unit:

    unsigned diagnosticCount = clang_getNumDiagnostics(tu);
Then loop through all of them, fetching each one in turn:

    for(unsigned i = 0; i < diagnosticCount; i++) {
        CXDiagnostic diagnostic = clang_getDiagnostic(tu, i);
I want to print the location of each diagnostic, as well as the text. Getting the location is easy:

        CXSourceLocation location = clang_getDiagnosticLocation(diagnostic);
What do we do with a CXSourceLocation, though? Fortunately, it's fairly easy to turn this into line and column numbers:

        clang_getSpellingLocation(location, NULL, &line, &column, NULL);
The two NULL parameters can be used to obtain the file where the diagnostic occurred and its absolute offset within the file. There are several concepts of "location" that can be obtained from a CXSourceLocation, depending on exactly how you want to treat macro expansions and #line directives. clang_getSpellingLocation produces the final spot in the source file where the diagnostic occurred, which seems the most natural, at least for a basic exploration of libclang.

Finally, I want to know what the diagnostic actually says:

        CXString text = clang_getDiagnosticSpelling(diagnostic);
For reasons which aren't entirely clear to me, the term "spelling" is frequently used in the libclang API to indicate the textual content of an item. It's a bit odd, but not hard to work with, just something to be aware of when trying to find a function.

We don't know how to print a CXString, but fortunately it's easy to turn that into a C string by calling clang_getCString. The program can then print the diagnostic:

        fprintf(stderr, "%u:%u: %s\n", line, column, clang_getCString(text));
Finally, clean up the diagnostic string:

        clang_disposeString(text);
    }
Walking the Tree
Source code gets parsed into a tree, where the textual code is represented as a hierarchy of objects. A local variable is contained within a scope which is contained within a function which is contained within a file, for example. libclang produces this tree and allows us to walk through it to find things. To illustrate how that works, I'll show code that prints every variable declaration in the file.

Rather than expose the tree directly, libclang provides API that will walk the tree, invoking a callback at every node. There's a version that takes a function pointer, and fortunately there's another version that takes a block. Each node of the tree is represented as a CXCursor. The function takes an arbitrary cursor and walks its children, and then there's a convenient helper to get the top-level cursor for a translation unit:

    clang_visitChildrenWithBlock(clang_getTranslationUnitCursor(tu), ^(CXCursor cursor, CXCursor parent){
Each cursor has a kind that indicates just what this thing is. We want variable declarations, so check for that:

        if(clang_getCursorKind(cursor) == CXCursor_VarDecl) {
The first thing we'll do is find out where the cursor is located. Cursors don't directly expose a location, but rather a range. Of course, a range is just a start and end, and I'll grab the start location as the cursor's location:

            CXSourceRange range = clang_getCursorExtent(cursor);
            CXSourceLocation location = clang_getRangeStart(range);
Next, I want to pull useful information out of that CXSourceLocation. The call is much like before, although I want to extract the file as well, not just the line and column numbers. This is because libclang will find not only variable declarations in my own file, but also in headers that it includes, and I want to know where each declaration was:

            CXFile file;
            unsigned line;
            unsigned column;
            clang_getFileLocation(location, &file, &line, &column, NULL);
A CXFile by itself isn't enough. Instead, I want the file's name:

            CXString filename = clang_getFileName(file);
I also want the variable's name, which is just the text content (or "spelling") of the cursor itself:

            CXString name = clang_getCursorSpelling(cursor);
Now I'm ready to print the information:

            fprintf(stderr, "%s:%u:%u: found variable %s\n", clang_getCString(filename), line, column, clang_getCString(name));
And clean up the strings:

            clang_disposeString(name);
            clang_disposeString(filename);
        }
Finally, the block returns a value which indicates whether traversal should halt, skip children, or recurse into children. We want to visit everything, so we'll tell libclang to recurse:

        return CXChildVisit_Recurse;
    });
Let's try it out. Here's the output it produces on my file:

    libclang.m:9:5: found variable index
    libclang.m:11:5: found variable args
    libclang.m:15:5: found variable numArgs
    libclang.m:17:5: found variable tu
    libclang.m:19:5: found variable diagnosticCount
    libclang.m:20:9: found variable i
    libclang.m:21:9: found variable diagnostic
    libclang.m:23:9: found variable location
    libclang.m:24:9: found variable line
    libclang.m:24:24: found variable column
    libclang.m:27:9: found variable text
    libclang.m:34:13: found variable range
    libclang.m:35:13: found variable location
    libclang.m:37:13: found variable file
    libclang.m:38:13: found variable line
    libclang.m:39:13: found variable column
    libclang.m:42:13: found variable filename
    libclang.m:44:13: found variable name
It works!

Cleaning Up
Both the index and translation unit are objects that we hold onto and are responsible for disposing of. Cleaning them up is, fortunately, easy:

    clang_disposeTranslationUnit(tu);

    clang_disposeIndex(index);
Conclusion
libclang provides a nice interface for using Clang's knowledge of C and similar languages to find information about source files. It's possible to create and walk the abstract syntax tree, generate errors and warnings, and even perform autocompletion. I've only scratched the surface of what's possible, but I hope it's enough to get you started.
